Step 1: Make the Cake
Prepare your pan & preheat the oven. Prepare three 8 inch cake pans with parchment paper circles in the bottom, and grease the sides. Preheat oven to 300°F (148°C).
Mix the dry ingredients. Add all dry ingredients to a large bowl and whisk together.
Add the wet ingredients. Add eggs, buttermilk and vegetable oil to the dry ingredients and mix well. Add vanilla to boiling water and add to mixture. Mix well.
Bake. Divide batter evenly between cakes pans and bake for 30-33 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with a few crumbs.
Cool. Remove cakes from oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes, then remove to cooling racks to cool completely.

Step 2: Make the Chocolate Buttercream Frosting
I usually make the chocolate frosting while the cakes cool. Here’s how:

Beat the butter and shortening together in a stand mixer until smooth.
Add the sugar. Slowly add 4 cups (460g) of powdered sugar and mix until smooth.
Add vanilla and half of the water or milk and mix until smooth.
More sugar. Add another 5 cups (575g) of powdered sugar and mix until smooth.
Mix in the cocoa powder. Add cocoa and mix until smooth.
Add remaining water or milk until the frosting is the right consistency.
Step 3: Frost Your Chocolate Cake
Once cakes are cool, remove cake domes from top with a large serrated knife. See my tips on how to level a cake and how to stack a cake.

Frost the first layer. Place first layer of cake on cake plate. Spread about 1 cup of frosting on top in an even layer.
Frost the second layer. Add second layer of cake and add another cup of frosting on top in an even layer.
Add more frosting. Frost the outside of the entire cake to finish things up. Feel free to use my tutorial for frosting a smooth cake.

Step 4: Make the Chocolate Ganache & Add More Frosting
Technically you could just stop right here. By this point you’ll have an amazing chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream frosting! But if you want to go a bit fancy, this chocolate ganache is an easy way to do it.

To make the chocolate ganache:

Add the chocolate chips to a medium sized bowl (see my tips on making chocolate ganache).
Heat the heavy whipping cream just until it begins to boil, then pour it over the chocolate chips. Allow it to sit for 2-3 minutes, then whisk until smooth.
That’s it. Just two steps! Then you add the ganache to your chocolate cake:

Drizzle the chocolate ganache around the edge of the cake, then pour the remainder of the ganache on top of the cake and spread evenly. I like to use a squeeze bottle for drizzling around the edges. See my tips on making a chocolate drip cake.
Allow the ganache to firm up a bit
Pipe the remainder of the frosting around the top edge of the cake and pipe a border around the bottom. I used Ateco tip 844.
Step 5: Sprinkles and Serve!
Add a few sprinkles to the cake, if desired, then serve.
